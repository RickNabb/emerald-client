## Configuration

## How to Run

### Dependencies

For now, we need to run `babel-node` to get the project running. This will be removed in favor of adding a build process with Babel as one step in the near future.

```bash
npm install -g babel-cli
```

### Run the thing

```bash
babel-node --use-strict beryl.js
```
